2. Build a React component that displays 3 or more squares to the user.
3. Style the squares however you like.
4. Implement functionality:
   - When clicking on a square, its background color changes.

## Part 2 (Bonus):
*(To be continued after class or during flex time)*

   - Allow the user to guess (click) a square until they uncover the square hiding the text or image.
   
2. Extras:
   - When the text/image is found, display a celebratory message to the user.
   - Give the user a limited amount of guesses, displaying the remaining guesses to the user.
